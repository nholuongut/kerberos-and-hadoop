This manuscript discusses low-level issues related to Apache&trade; Hadoop&reg; and Kerberos

## Disclaimer

Just as the infamous [Necronomicon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380751925) is a collection
of notes scrawled in blood as a warning to others, this book is

1. Incomplete.
1. Based on experience and superstition, rather than understanding and insight.
1. Contains information that will drive the reader insane.

Reading this book implies recognition of these facts and that the reader, their estate and
their heirs accept all risk and liability. The author is not responsible if anything happens
to their Apache Hadoop cluster, including all the data stored in HDFS disappearing into an unknown dimension,
or the YARN scheduler starting to summon pre-human deities.

**You have been warned**


## Implementation notes.

1. This is a work in progress book designed to built using the [gitbook tool chain](https://github.com/nholuongut/gitbook).

1. It is hosted on [github](https://github.com/nholuongut/kerberos-and-hadoop).
Pull requests are welcome.

1. All the content is Apache licensed.

1. This is not a formal support channel for Hadoop + Kerberos problems. If you have a support
contract with [Hortonworks](http://hortonworks.com/) then issues related to Kerberos may 
eventually reach the author. Otherwise: try 

      - [Hortonworks Answerhub](https://community.hortonworks.com/answers/index.html)
      - The users mailing list of Apache Hadoop, the application and you are using on top of it.
      - [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=hadoop+kerberos).
