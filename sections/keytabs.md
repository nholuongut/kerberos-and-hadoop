# Keytabs

Keytabs are critical for secure Hadoop clusters, as they allow the services to be launched
without prompts for passwords


## Creating a Keytab

If your management tools sets up keytabs for you: use it.

```bash

kadmin.local

ktadd -k zk.service.keytab -norandkey zookeeper/devix@COTHAM 
ktadd -k zk.service.keytab -norandkey zookeeper/devix.cotham.uk@COTHAM
exit
```

and of course, make it accessible

```bash
chgrp hadoop zk.service.keytab
chown zookeeper zk.service.keytab
```

check that the user can login

```bash
# sudo -u zookeeper klist -e -kt zk.service.keytab
# sudo -u zookeeper kinit -kt zk.service.keytab zookeeper/devix.cotham.uk
# sudo -u zookeeper klist
```

### Keytab Expiry

Keytabs expire

That is: entries in them have a limited lifespan (default: 1 year)

This is actually a feature â€”it limits how long a lost/stolen keytab can have access to the system.

At the same time, it's a major inconvenience as (a) the keytabs expire and (b) it's never
immediately obvious why your cluster has stopped working.

### Keytab security

Keytabs are sensitive items. They need to be treated as having all the access to the data of that principal
